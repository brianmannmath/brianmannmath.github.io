I have no idea what I'm doing.

-------------------------

I have no idea, let's check.

### How does this work?

##Let's put some code in here and find out!

{%codeblock lang:hs %}

{% endcodeblock %}


Oh good it works.

# Checking if LaTex works:

$$
f \mbox{ is continuous if for all } \epsilon > 0 \mbox{ there exists a } \delta > 0...
